    numpy
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the McDonald's dataset, which includes customer attributes related to their preferences and behaviors. The dataset is in CSV format and can be found in the repository.
Methodology

    Data Preprocessing:
        Load and clean the dataset.
        Handle missing values and normalize features.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Visualize the data to understand customer behaviors and preferences.

    Clustering Techniques:
        Apply KMeans and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for clustering.
        Evaluate the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method and silhouette scores.

Clustering Techniques
KMeans

KMeans clustering is a centroid-based algorithm that partitions the data into K clusters based on feature similarity.
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

GMM is a probabilistic model that assumes the data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions. It is useful for modeling clusters with different shapes and sizes.
Results

The results of the clustering analysis, including visualizations and insights into the identified customer segments, are documented in the Jupyter Notebook included in this repository.
